platform where user gets paid on completing different tasks

The Online Earning Platform is a web-based application that allows users to complete different tasks and earn money. The platform includes various tasks such as surveys, watching videos, and playing games. Users can complete these tasks and get paid for their efforts.

As a developer, my role in the project was to create a spinner page and referral functionality. The spinner page allows users to click on the spinner and win balance on their account if they win. I integrated the Stripe payment method through the Stripe API key into the Laravel project to make transactions secure and easy for users.

The referral functionality allows users to send their referral link to their friends or acquaintances. When a user signs up on the platform using that referral link, both the referring user and the new user get a credit balance on their account. This encourages users to invite others to join the platform and earn more money.

The website was live at (https://adsbazar.xyz/), but it is not live anymore, possibly due to a change in the domain or other reasons. The code I provided above does not have the latest features that I included, as I was working on the client's live server after delivering the project the first time.
